Description
===========

This is an api with 2 endpoints for displaying product information. adding a product takes place in a console in a
runnable shell

The server runs on flask

P.S. in the files make-dist.sh make-stable.sh the value of the server from where you can download is not registered,
since the pip is not uploaded. if necessary and maintaining your server, you will only need to enter the address for
placing this on it (of course, if you have prepared everything you need in advance)
